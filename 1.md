This is a mixed blessing. On one hand, it’s nice to have the freedom to do whatever you like. On the other hand, many different methods of formatting C++ programs have been developed throughout the years, and you will find (sometimes significant and distracting) disagreement on which ones are best.

这是一种喜忧参半的情况。一方面，可以随心所欲地做事是一件很好的事情。另一方面，多年来已经发展了许多不同的C++程序格式化方法，你会发现（有时是重大且分散注意力的）关于哪种方法最好的分歧。

Our basic rule of thumb is that the best styles are the ones that produce the most readable code, and provide the most consistency.

我们的基本原则是，最好的风格是那些能产生最易读的代码，并提供最高一致性的风格。

Proponents of using tabs wonder why you wouldn’t use the character designed to do indentation for indentation, especially as you can set the width to whatever your personal preference is. There’s no right answer here -- and debating it is like arguing whether cake or pie is better. It ultimately comes down to personal preference.

使用制表符的支持者会好奇，为什么不使用专为缩进设计的字符来进行缩进，尤其是当你可以根据个人偏好设置宽度时。这里没有正确的答案——讨论这个问题就像争论蛋糕和派哪个更好一样。这最终归结为个人偏好。

Thus, both output statements do the same thing (print the value 5). But in the case of the literal, the value 5 can be printed directly. In the case of the variable, the value 5 must be fetched from the memory the variable represents.

> Both _ do the same thing. But in the case of _ . In the case of _ .

Much like a person’s lifetime is defined to be the time between their birth and death, an object’s lifetime is defined to be the time between its creation and destruction.

Although your program will compile, per the best practice above, you should not rely on this.

> Although your _ , per the best _ , you should not rely on this.

Using this method almost always amounts to overkill.

> 在这里，"amounts" 的意思是指达到、等同于或相当于。所以这句话的意思是，使用这种方法几乎总是过度的。
